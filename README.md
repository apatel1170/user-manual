### Core Strengths
> Systems thinking, strategic synthesis, and analytical reasoning.

### Working Hours
> 9:30 AM – 5:30 PM PT. I often pull a second shift from 8-11 PM. If you get a late message, there is zero expectation of a response until the morning.

### Communication Bias
> Written > Verbal. I think (and sometimes overthink) before I type.

### Decision Style
> Logic + intuition, validated by data.



## 🎯 Current Areas of Focus

### Scaling
> Building systems to support the mission and 0 -> 1 stage of AI startups.

### Structural Improvements
> Moving away from "one-off wins" toward long-term, durable workflows.

### High-Leverage Projects
> Prioritizing work with measurable impact over surface-level polish.



## 🧠 How I Think & Make Decisions

### Simple Building Blocks
> I reduce complexity into simple mental models. If I ask many questions, I’m trying to find the first principles to build upward from.

### Pattern Recognition
> I look for root causes and data patterns rather than surface metrics.

### Linear Logic + Gut
> I am a logical thinker, but I allow intuition—honed by past experience—to guide the final call.

### Precision Matters
> I value clear reasoning over jargon. If I am being vague, please call it out.



## 🏆 What I Value

### Radical Candor
> Directness and accuracy beat optics every time. I expect truth-seeking in our professional interactions.

### Levity
> Work is better when we don't take ourselves too seriously. I value humor as a tool to diffuse tension and build genuine rapport—expect a dry sense of humor and the occasional strong opinion on why zucchini has no place in a sandwich.

### Deep Ownership
> If you see a gap in a workflow, own the fix regardless of your title.

### Context Depth
> I need to understand stakeholders and incentives at the workflow level to feel confident in a path forward.

### Bias for Action (with Rigor)
> Move fast, but understand *why* we are moving in that direction.



## 🤝 How to Work With Me

### Bring Structure
> Define the problem, assumptions, and success criteria upfront.

### Data + Narrative
> Numbers are incomplete without interpretation. Bring the metrics, but tell the story behind them.

### Prepared, Not Perfect
> I am a perfectionist by nature, but I am practicing the 80/20 rule. Early drafts are better than delayed perfection—just label them as such.

### Collaborative Framing
> I prefer executing independently once we have aligned on the "why" and the goals collaboratively.

### Escalate Early
> Flag risks and blockers quickly. I hate being the last to know about a "fire."



## 💬 How I Like to Communicate

### Written First
> Clear messages with context and intent. I may respond slower but more fully.

### High-Signal Meetings
> Pre-reads are required, agendas are preferred. Fewer meetings are always better.

### Live Conversation
> If a thread becomes too nuanced or slow, let’s jump on a quick Slack huddle or Zoom.

### Verbal Processing
> I use filler words while I think. If I’m "waffling," ask me for a concrete bottom line.

### Feedback
> Direct and timely. If something is off, say it plainly and early.



## 🔍 Blind Spots (Help Me Here)

### Tunnel Vision
> I can become obstinate or over-analyze before shipping. Pull me back to the big picture if I’m stuck.

### Boundary Setting
> I often get distracted by Slack or "meeting anticipation." Remind me to protect time for deep work.

### Morning Lag
> I am not a morning person. For high-stakes logic puzzles, catch me after 10:00 AM.



##  What Makes Me Happy

### The Nirvana of Completion
> Finishing a project with absolutely no loose ends is my professional happy place.

### Relationships
> I care about who you are. Tell me about your life and hobbies. I’m a fan of the Golden State Valkyries, an avid golfer, and a listener of Alt J, Grateful Dead, and Tame Impala, among many others.

### Family
> I come from a large family, and they are my paramount priority.
